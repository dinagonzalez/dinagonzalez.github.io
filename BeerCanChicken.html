                    With summer around the corner, and having dinners outside in the backyard, Beer Can Lime Chicken is one of my go to recipes. One day when shopping at Bed Bath and Beyond, I came across the beer can chicken stand and had to buy it. It looked like such a fun way to cook chicken. I tossed the stand in a drawer with all my other cooking gadgets and completely forgot about it. A few years went by and while cleaning, I came across it. I set it aside so that I could finally use it and see if it was worth holding on to.

                        </ul>

                            <li>Place oven rack on the lowest level. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
                            <li> Rinse and pat dry the chicken. Then rub oil all over the chicken and season well with Pepper Plant Seasoning. On a baking sheet, place beer can stand with beer (pour out 1/4) and then sit the chicken on top, upright.</li>
                            <li>Cut lime in half. One half of the lime, slice into four thin slices. Sprinkle slices with Pepper Plant Seasoning and place them between the skin and the breast, placing two slices on each breast. The other half of the lime, place on top of the cavity (where the neck would be).</li>
                            <li>Roast chicken for 1 hour and 15 minutes. When done (165 degrees F.), carefully remove chicken from oven and let rest for 15 minutes. Without burning yourself, remove chicken from stand and enjoy!</li>

                                <li>For easy clean up, cover baking sheet with foil or parchment paper.</li>  
                                <li>After baking for 30 minutes, loosely tent the chicken with foil, so that the top doesnâ€™t burn.</li>  
                                <li>About half way through the cooking time (35min.), toss some potatoes on the baking sheet with the chicken and you'll have a complete meal.</li>
